# AI Security Workshop: Claude Code plugins

Security tools for Claude Code, used in the AI security and guardrails workshop.

## security-advisor

Skills make Claude Code more capable, but a skill is also code and instructions from a third party. A malicious skill can hide prompt injection, read secrets or send data to an external server.

The **security-advisor** plugin watches your session and helps you use skills safely:

- It checks the skills you use for prompt injection and hidden instructions.
- It finds data exfiltration patterns, for example requests to unknown servers.
- It identifies unsafe tool use, for example commands that delete or upload files.
- It warns you before a risky skill runs.

security-advisor works in the Claude Code CLI, Claude Code Desktop and the Claude Code VS Code extension. It needs no settings.
